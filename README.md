# Introduction
## Hackathon Problem Statement 
Identify some MLB Pitchers who could be better off in a different role - perhaps as a starter, a reliever, setup guy, swingman, or something entirely different. 

Identify characteristics of pitchers that lead to their success in specific roles, such as a traditional “starting pitcher”, a traditional “relief pitcher”, or any other pitching roles that we establish with our own analysis. Using our findings, find 2-3 pitchers who can be best suited for another role and why might these role switches be better for them?

# Technologies Used
## Python Distribution
This project uses [Python 3.11.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3114/).

## Getting Started Poetry and .venv
There are two options to get started with this project.

Option 1:

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies and virtual environments. To install Poetry, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

To install the project's dependencies, navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command:

```bash
poetry update pyproject.toml
```

Option 2:

If you do not want to use Poetry, you can activate a virtual environment and install the project's dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
source .venv/scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
